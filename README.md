# Cryptographic-Functions-using-Cryptography

The program calls different cryptographic functions and measure the speed of different cryptographic operations. For that purpose, 3 different files of sizes 1KB, 1MB and 10MB have been used. The program implements and measures the runtime of the following functionalities:

<ul>
<li>AES in CBC mode with 128-bit key.</li>
<li>AES in CTR mode with 128 and 256-bit key.</li>
<li>RSA implementation with PKCS #1 v2 padding-OAEP using 2048 and 3072-bit key.</li>
<li>Hash Function implementations - SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA3-256.</li>
<li>DSA implementation using 2048 and 3072-bit key and SHA-256 hash function.</li>
</ul>
